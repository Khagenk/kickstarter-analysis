# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project:

### The purpose of the project was to analyze a large amount of data gathered for kickstarts from all around the world to come up with a simpler and easier to understand chart/graph that explains all of those data. The data alone in the excel sheet is not sufficient enough for it to tell us what we want to know. In the meantime, it would take countless hours to go over every Kickstarter, thus this project, which made it possible to organize those data, by shortening, filtering, and narrowing down using many of the Excel features. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I performed my analysis using pivot tables, conditional if's function in excel as well as the measure of central tendency. It was challenging to figure out the criteria and range for the COUNTIFS() function. I had to spend a whole day plugging things in and taking the thing out till I finally figured it out. 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion you can draw is that projects that started in or around May and June had the most success rate out of all other months. Another conclusion you can make is that based on the data there is a 60/40 chance of the project either being completed or failed/canceled respectively. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
In the line graph, the outcome based on the funding goal amount shows the success of the failed chart is inversely related to one another. In addition, it also that most porject below 5000 do fairely well. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A large dataset from the Kickstarter such as this one was uniquely inversely related. This could mean that there are other datasets that we are not looking for but are equally significant. Other possible limitation includes too much or too little data. For example, we had more than enough data for the successful project but not enough for canceled. I would also say another limitation of this dataset is the ability for the user to interpret the data to its fullest. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Possible tables and graphs we could create are boxes and whiskers to see any outliers. We can also create a pie chart to show the comparison between the failed and successful projects
